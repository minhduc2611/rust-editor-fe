### Naming convention
[This is a very good recommendation from the Vue team](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/?redirect=true&fbclid=IwAR0Lp2z7Q-YtzX6KV3w2B-Jt-cs5KYl2OZDJzORgotqocshGZAz9ooRpzog#Base-component-names-strongly-recommended) on how to name components. I think it's a good idea to follow this recommendation. Make sure you read it.
